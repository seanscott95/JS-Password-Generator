# JavaScript: Password Generator

This code generates a new password that can include numbers, symbols, lower and upper case characters. The password length will be between 8 and 128 characters.

This code involved creating variables for the different character selections. When generate password is clicked alert boxes will appear one after the other asking if you do or dont want certain characters in your password as well as the length. Once entered a password will generate.
